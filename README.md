# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Hello There!
- I wanted to learn C++ so I said why not start like this üñ•Ô∏è!

## Planning
- Learned C++ during Summer 2024
- Planned game on paper and design
- Implemented Board class then GameLogic in order to have a starting base with the board
- Used knowledge of OOP and COMP303 (Design Patterns) in order to make a encapsulated game

## How to Play
- Clone the repository and make sure you have cpp compiler
- Run the code and start!
- Have two players enter name
- Symbols (X and O) will be chosen randomly and X will start
